## Novel Teaching Methods

I am experimenting with various instruments to improve my lectures and learning experience. 

* 2020 - [Method for Rapid Development of online Educational Games by Students](/teaching/edugames/)
* 2020 - [IoT support for hybrid lectures](/2021-04-17-DBE-IoTHackathon/)
* 2017 - [Data Driven Lectures (DDL)](/teaching/ddl/)

## Masters Programmes @HHZ

Lectures on [Digital Business Engineering (DBE)](https://www.hhz.de/master/digital-business-engineering/) and [Digital Business Management (DBM)](http://www.digitalbusinessmaster.de/) take place every term at the HHZ. 
Some of them are held in our [Smart Environment](/research/se/) for data driven lecturing (DDL).

## Projects
Term or two-term projects conducted by students.

## Lectures

Lectures take place every term at the HHZ and the Reutlingen University. 
Some of them are organized as [Data Driven Lectures (DDL)](/teaching/ddl/). DDL was awared by the [Hochschullehrpreis](/aboutme/) of the Reutlingen University.
I also utilize educational quiz games. These were developed by students for students. Have a look on my awared [Method for Rapid Development of online Educational Games by Students](/teaching/edugames/).
